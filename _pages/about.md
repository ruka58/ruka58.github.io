I am a Research Fellow in [CSIT](https://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/csit/) at Queen's University Belfast. My research aims to produce **secure, low-power, lightweight** hardware for embedded systems and AI models. My research interests include approximate computing, inteconnect techniques, Trusted Exection Environment (TEE), and wireless communication. 

Prior to that, I was a Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham participating in the [CAP-TEE Project](https://cap-tee.org/) with [Prof. David Oswald](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/computer-science/academic-staff/oswald-david). I completed my PhD at the [APT Group](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/expertise/advanced-processor-technologies/) of the University of Manchester (2018-2022) under the supervisor of [Dr Vasilis F. Pavlidis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-hDlKqwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
