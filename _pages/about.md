I am a Research Fellow at [CSIT](https://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/csit/), Queen's University Belfast. My research aims to build **secure, energy-efficient, lightweight** hardware for embedded systems and AI applications. My research interests spans a range areas including side-channel attacks, fault injection attacks, approximate computing, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and wireless communication, combining power/area/performance with robust hardware-level security. 

Prior to that, I was a Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham participating in the [CAP-TEE Project](https://cap-tee.org/) under the supervision of [Prof. David Oswald](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/computer-science/academic-staff/oswald-david), focusing on the design of capability-based TEEs. I completed my PhD from the [APT Group](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/expertise/advanced-processor-technologies/) at the University of Manchester (2018-2022), where I was supervised by [Dr Vasilis F. Pavlidis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-hDlKqwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
